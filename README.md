# IV Web Resources

### Introduction
Hello! This is Kekoa, a student leader currently in charge of handling the technology stuff at BeachIV (CSULB InterVarsity)! I believe that there is a lot of potential and growth in expanding God's kingdom! Thus, I was sparked the desire to create this repository to provide resources and documentation on the tools and code I use. Everything here is provided free of charge with help on showing you how to via the wiki.
